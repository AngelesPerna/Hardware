## Introduction
EDU-FPGA is an open source FPGA development board based on [Lattice iCE40HX4K](http://www.latticesemi.com/iCE40), and is part of **FPGA Para Todos** project, which is aimed to bring educational resources for FPGA technologies. EDU-FPGA supports [IceStorm](http://www.clifford.at/icestorm/) open source toolchain and is designed to be a low cost solution for beginners and intermediate students or professionals who wants to start studying FPGA's technologies or deepen their knowledges on this field. Currently, there are two versions of the board: v1.0 and v1.2. The following image shows both:

The board on the right is v1.2 (last version), and it has improvements on smd oscillator, USB footprint, flash memory and push-buttons, to make it more suitable for manufacture. 

More resources and information about **FPGA Para Todos** can be found on project's Wiki [here](https://gitlab.com/RamadrianG/wiki---fpga-para-todos/-/wikis/FPGA-para-Todos).
